# **Project Title:** ISBN_Searcher

## **Description:**

This Python project provides an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) prototype for an API that retrieves book information (title and number of pages) based on the ISBN code. It's designed to be used by API users to access book details efficiently.

## **User Story:**

As an API user, I want to be able to request book information such as title and number of pages based on the ISBN code.
-Is the langauge of the books important?
-Does the genre of the book matter?
-Would it be helpful if the API could also handle requests for additional parameters in the future?

## **Installation:**
